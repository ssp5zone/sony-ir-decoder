# Sony IR Remote Decoder

Decoder stubs written to understand the signals generated by Sony infra red remotes. Basically you can use the remote to control/operate other things. Add your logic in,
```C
void doStuff(unsigned char value) {
  // your code here
}
```

There are 2 codes,
1. Written for Microchip's 16F series devices in `mikroC` compiler.
2. Written for Microchip's 18F series devices in `MPLAB-C18` compiler.

The codes have 2 versions,
1. Manual read via _polling_.
2. Auto read via _interrupts_.
